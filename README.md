# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

A recommender system, or a recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.

Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognised examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders.

# Types of Recommender Systems

# Content-based filtering system: 
Content-Based recommender system tries to guess the features or behavior of a user given the item’s features, he/she reacts positively to. Content-based filtering does not require other users' data during recommendations to one user.

# Collaborative filtering System:

It considers other users’ reactions while recommending a particular user. It notes which items a particular user likes and also the items that the users with behavior and likings like him/her likes, to recommend items to that user.

It collects user feedbacks on different items and uses them for recommendations.
